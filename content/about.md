## Where I've been {#where-i-ve-been}

I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, a great (no longer) little city. Austin is one of the hottest cities in the US, but it makes up for that with tacos and queso, live music, outdoor activities, and good vibes.

A scholarship offer, nearby family, and a spark of interest generated in an AP psychology class drew me to Dallas after high school to study psychology at the University of Texas at Dallas.
Dallas' distinguishing features to me have been its size (Dallas-Fort Worth is larger than Rhode Island, and Dallas-Fort Worth airport is larger than Manhattan), its insane highway interchanges, and its great food.

Now, I'm in Minneapolis, Minnesota pursuing a PhD in psychology at the University of Minnesota.
I work in the Auditory Perception and Cognition Lab there.
As a native Texan, I had imagined that the only pastime of Minnesotans would be ice fishing and snow shoveling, but so far I've enjoyed Minneapolis' parks, bikes, and music!

In the summer of 2019, I took a detour to Denmark to do an internship at Oticon's [Eriksholm Research Center](https://eriksholm.com).
At Eriksholm, I worked with Lars Bramsl√∏w on a project investigating the use of deep neural networks for speech segregation speech denoising.
