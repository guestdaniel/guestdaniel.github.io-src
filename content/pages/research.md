**PI:** Andrew Oxenham

I joined the Auditory Perception and Cognition Lab in September 2017. My research spans a variety of topics in psychoacoustics and computational modeling of the auditory system.

- **Neural basis of pitch perception:** My PhD focuses on investigating pitch perception with harmonic complex tones composed of low-numbered but high-frequency harmonics (e.g., harmonics 6-10 of a 1400 Hz F0). Previous research has demonstrated accurate pitch perception is possible with such stimuli despite the fact that such stimuli do not elicit strong phase locking to TFS in the auditory nerve. My goal is to elucidate the neural code that underlies this phenomenon. To this end, I am combining psychophysical methods, computational methods, and ideas from statistical estimation theory (e.g., Cramér–Rao lower bound) to probe the ability of listeners to perceive pitch in mixtures of complex tones at high frequencies.

- **Role of pitch in the complex auditory scene:** In my first project in the lab, I examined how F0 differences between a target talker and harmonic complex tone masker benefit speech segregation under a variety of conditions.

-----------------

**Time**: March 2019 - present

**PI:** Kendrick Kay 

As part of my [NSF-NRT Graduate Training Program in Sensory Science Fellowship](http://catss.umn.edu/opportunities.htm), I am currently pursuing a research project in the Computational Visual Neuroscience Lab. I am using encoding models and functional connectivity methods to explore responses in the visual pulvinar in the [Natural Scenes Dataset](http://naturalscenesdataset.org/), a massive multi-session, multi-subject, high-resolution fMRI dataset collected at the [Center for Magnetic Resonance Research](https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/). 

[Eriksholm Research Center][10]
-----------------

**Time**: May 2019 - August 2019 

**PI:** Lars Bramsløw

During the summer of 2019, I worked as a research intern at Oticon's Eriksholm Research Center. At Eriskholm, I researched tools and techniques for visualizing and interpreting deep neural networks designed to process and separate speech. 

[UT Dallas Speech Perception Lab][1]
-----------------

**Time**: May 2015 - May 2017 

**PI:** Peter Assmann

As an undergraduate research assistant, my primary role was working on a project investigating perception of indexical properties in children's speech. Using stimuli from the [North Texas Vowel Database](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~assmann/KIDVOW1/North_Texas_vowel_database.html) modified by the [STRAIGHT vocoder][3], I examined how listeners utilize fundamental frequency and formant frequencies when perceiving age and gender in children's speech. In particular, I focused on conditions of reduced spectrotemporal resolution (through the use of tone vocoders) and on differences between normal-hearing and cochlear-implant listeners.
