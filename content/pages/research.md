As an undergraduate research assistant, my primary role was working on a project investigating perception of indexical properties in children's speech. Using stimuli from the North Texas Vowel Database modified by the [STRAIGHT vocoder][3], I examined how listeners utilize fundamental frequency and formant frequencies when perceiving age and gender in children's speech. In particular, I focused on conditions of reduced spectrotemporal resolution (through the use of tone vocoders) and on differences between normal-hearing and cochlear-implant listeners. This research culminated in an honors thesis entitled "Perception of voice gender in children's speech".
