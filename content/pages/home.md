In Fall 2017 I will be a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. I will be studying auditory perception in Dr. Andrew Oxenham's [Auditory Perception and Cognition Lab][8].

Formerly, I earned a BS in Psychology from the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. I worked in Dr. Peter Assmann's [Speech Perception Lab][7], where I focused on perception of indexical properties in children's speech by normal-hearing and cochlear-implant listeners.

I have a broad basis of training in psychology, speech and hearing, and mathematics. Additionally, I have experience with programming in a number of languages, statistical modeling, digital signal processing, and creating publications with LaTeX.
